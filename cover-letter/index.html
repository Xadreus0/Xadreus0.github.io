  <h2>Cover Letter – Graduate Engineer Application</h2>

<p>
<strong>Position:</strong> Graduate Engineer<br>
<strong>Organisation:</strong> Industrus Engineering
</p>

<p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>I am writing to apply for the Graduate Engineer position at Industrus Engineering. I am a graduate-level Mechatronics Engineer with hands-on experience delivering production-ready automation and manufacturing systems in live industrial environments. My current role within HVAC manufacturing has given me practical exposure to multidisciplinary engineering work, professional accountability, and the realities of engineering delivery—experience that strongly aligns with Industrus Engineering’s graduate consulting program.</p>
  <p>Through my current role at Price Holyoake, I have worked on the design, build, and commissioning of semi-automated manufacturing systems used in live HVAC production. These projects required a strong commitment to professional accountability and ethical conduct, particularly when delivering equipment intended for long-term production use. I was responsible for ensuring designs were safe, reliable, maintainable, and compliant with internal quality expectations, as well as documenting and validating systems prior to handover to operators and production teams.</p>
  <p>Effective communication has been central to my work. I regularly collaborate with engineers, technicians, production staff, and supervisors to translate design intent into practical outcomes. This has included producing clear documentation, supporting commissioning and troubleshooting activities, and providing operator training to ensure systems were understood and used safely. Working across these groups has strengthened my ability to communicate technical information clearly to both engineering and non-engineering stakeholders.</p>
  <p>I have thrived in environments that demand creativity, innovation, and initiative. Within tight budget and time constraints, I have designed and delivered custom automation solutions that replaced manual processes, improved consistency, and increased throughput. Developing two semi-automated laser-welding systems from concept through to production deployment within a combined budget of $7,500 required proactive problem-solving, rapid iteration, and a willingness to take ownership of outcomes.</p>
  <p>My roles have also required disciplined use and management of technical information. I routinely work across CAD models, electrical schematics, control logic, embedded code, and testing documentation to ensure systems are coherent and traceable. Managing this information effectively has been essential for debugging, future modifications, and ensuring continuity between design, commissioning, and production.</p>
  <p>I take a structured approach to managing my own performance in professional environments. Balancing project delivery with production support has required prioritisation, time management, and accountability for results. I actively seek feedback, reflect on outcomes, and apply lessons learned to improve future work, particularly in areas such as design-for-manufacture and system documentation.</p>
  <p>Finally, I have extensive experience working as part of multidisciplinary teams and stepping into leadership roles when required. While collaborating closely with senior engineers and technicians, I have also taken responsibility for specific subsystems and projects, coordinating tasks, supporting others during commissioning, and contributing to shared project goals. These experiences have reinforced the importance of teamwork, reliability, and clear communication in engineering practice.</p>
  <p>I am motivated to contribute practical engineering capability to Industrus Engineering while continuing to develop as a consulting engineer through the Graduate Program. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience delivering real-world engineering solutions, working across disciplines, and operating in production environments can add value to your team.</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br>Alex Cacciola</p>
