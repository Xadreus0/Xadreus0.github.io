During my internship I was responsible for designing and fabricating two production rigs. After our initial design review, my CAD assemblies were approved, and I ordered the required materials. Only a week later, my supervisor was reassigned to the Melbourne plant for six weeks to address an urgent production issue, leaving me largely independent during the fabrication stage. At first, I felt confident moving ahead, but as fabrication progressed, I encountered challenges that made me increasingly aware of the sustainability implications of my decisions.

I had deliberately over-ordered tubing, wiring and components to compensate for my lack of fabrication experience. I believed this was a responsible buffer given the likelihood of mistakes. However, using only hand tools such as angle grinders and hand drills, I quickly realised my CAD tolerances were unrealistic. Hole positions drifted, welded brackets distorted, and the shelf mechanism flexed under load. My wiring approach, based on whatever terminals I had available, became messy and difficult to troubleshoot. As these problems accumulated, my confidence shifted to anxiety about material waste, rework time and the risk of delaying production.

In hindsight, my assumptions played a major role in these difficulties. I expected approved CAD designs to translate directly into fabrication because at university I was used to working with CNC-level precision. I believed tight tolerances were acceptable and underestimated the variability inherent in hand fabrication. I also tried to work independently because my supervisor was under extreme pressure in Melbourne, and it felt inappropriate to interrupt him unless absolutely necessary.

These assumptions led to several sustainability issues: redesigning brackets and mechanisms due to fabrication inaccuracies, scrapping the shelf system in favour of a scissor-lift design, reworking the plenum alignment system, and rebuilding the electrical enclosure entirely after seeing a more appropriate industrial wiring approach. While unused material was eventually repurposed, the rework represented avoidable inefficiency in time, resources and energy.

Reflecting on this experience through the Engineers Australia Code of Ethics, as well as established manufacturing frameworks such as Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA), highlighted the importance of aligning design intent with fabrication capability. DfMA principles emphasise reducing unnecessary rework, minimising material waste, and designing within realistic process tolerances to improve system viability and sustainability (Boothroyd, Dewhurst, & Knight, 2011). I realised that sustainability is not limited to environmental impact; it also involves reducing inefficiencies arising from design–manufacture mismatch and understanding the practical limits of the manufacturing environment.

In future, I intend to integrate design-for-manufacture principles from the outset, align CAD tolerances with workshop capability, seek feedback earlier, and adopt structured wiring and documentation practices. This experience reshaped my understanding of sustainability: viable systems depend on realistic planning, responsible resource use and adapting designs to the constraints of real-world fabrication.
