  <h2>Reflection F – Professional Practice within intercultural and global contexts</h2>

<p><a href="/reflections/">← Back to reflections</a></p>

<!-- Paste your Reflection F text below, using <p> paragraphs. -->
  <p>During my internship, I designed and built a complex control system for one of the production rigs. I had completed clean electrical drawings and began wiring the enclosure using approaches familiar from university projects—basic screw terminals, soldered joints, improvised bridges, and a colour-coding scheme that quickly broke down as the system grew. I believed this was acceptable because it had always worked in previous projects. My supervisor had been sent to Melbourne for an urgent six-week assignment, so I continued independently, assuming my wiring was reasonably clear. This belief changed abruptly when he sent me a photo of a control box he was working on and asked a question about a component within it that I had experience with.</p>
  <p>When I opened the photo, I was immediately surprised by how clean and structured his wiring was. The DIN-rail terminal blocks, bridging links, and cable-management ducts were things I had never encountered before. I felt embarrassed and frustrated—not just because his work looked vastly more professional, but because I realised I had already lost one to two weeks navigating the chaos in my enclosure. My system had long looping cables, inconsistent terminal types, outdated labelling tape and several soldered joints running across the box. Debugging had become a nightmare; tracing a signal sometimes required building an LED tester just to work out which Raspberry Pi pin corresponded to which line. Seeing a higher standard reinforced that I needed to pivot immediately.</p>
  <p>When I asked him what the connection points were, he seemed amused at first but quickly concerned. After seeing my enclosure, he was blunt about the need to replace it and explained how industrial wiring differs from ad-hoc academic methods. He shared the control-box drawings he was using in Melbourne, and I realised that while my diagrams were neat, my physical wiring did not reflect industry expectations of clarity, maintainability and safety.</p>
  <p>This incident highlighted the intercultural aspect of engineering practice—not in a national sense, but in the cultural divide between academic and professional engineering environments. This distinction can be understood through the concept of communities of practice, where different professional groups develop shared norms, standards, and expectations around communication and technical work (Wenger, 1998). In industry, wiring must be interpretable and maintainable by anyone who inherits the system, whereas in academic projects it often only needs to function for the immediate project team.</p>
  <p>After this, I redesigned the entire box using DIN terminals, proper bridges, cable ducts and full terminal mapping. Traceability improved dramatically and wiring errors decreased. This experience taught me to prioritise professional communication through documentation and physical layout, and to recognise that engineering practice operates within its own professional culture. In future, I will adopt industry standards from the outset, especially when developing systems that others must rely on, and I will seek feedback earlier from more experienced practitioners rather than assuming that methods familiar in an academic context will translate directly into professional practice.</p>
